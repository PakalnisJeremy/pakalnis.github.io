### Opiate epidemic

For the past 5 years, the opiate epidemic has gone out of control. Thousand of people are overdosing from these terrible prescription drugs every year. Here are some statstics within the past couple years.

- From 1999 to 2016, more than 630,000 people have died from a drug overdose.
- Around 66% of the more than 63,600 drug overdose deaths in 2016 involved an opioid.
- In 2016, the number of overdose deaths involving opioids (including prescription opioids and illegal opioids like heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl) was 5 times higher than in 1999.
- On average, 115 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose.


### Mission
The purpose of this project is too help stop the problem at the roots before it actually becomes a problem. I beleive that the drug itself is not the problem, but the addiction disease lying within the person who is abusing these drugs. If we can tackle that problem before the addiction starts with the drugs, then I think we can help save many lives and help reduce the impact this opoid crisis is having on the United States.

### Prediction Data Analysis
With the new technology and algorithms that are available now, prediction data analysis can be performed on almost any datasets. After gathering datasets that explore addiction and drug abuse, prediction alaysis will be performed and the results of that analysis will be used to create the painkiller risk assessment tool (PRAT). Once this tool is created, it will be added to the website and anyone can use this tool to help determine whether they are at risk to abuse prescription medication.

### Steps
Here the the steps that will be taken during this project that will help achieve this goal.
1. Create a project proposal explaining how the project will be conducted.
2. Gather data on addiction and how it relates to drug overdoses. 
3. Gather data on the addiction gene and how likely certain people are to abuse prescription drugs.
4. Use jupyter notebook to perform data analysis on this data.
5. Create a painkiller risk assessment tool (PRAT) for doctors, clinics, and patients to use to help predict whether a patient is at high risk for abuse. 
6. Create a custom python jupyter kernel that anyone can use to perform data analysis.
7. Create a website that contains all the information on this data analysis, tutorials on how to perform this analysis, the PRAT, contact information, and much more.
8. Finalize everything in a powerpoint presentation.
